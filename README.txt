The folder is made up of serveral files.
images: This file include 3 pictures which is used to build the environment for visualization
Q table: The results of Q table
	  |__4*4 : Q table of the 4*4 environment of three algorithms
	  |__10*10 : Q table of the 10*10 environment of three algorithms
.py files:
	  |__Environment.py : Build the environment
	  |__Parameters.py : Set the parameters
	  |__Monte_Carlo_control.py : Perform Monte Carlo algorithm
	  |__Q_learning : Perform Q learning algorithm
	  |__SARSA : Perform SARSA algorithm
	  |__train.py : The main file to run all the algorithm by the input (can change the default value to get the results as expected)
	  |__test.py : Run the three algorithms simutaneously and get the figure for analysis

The PDF file is the report of this project. The parameters can be adjusted according to the report and get the desired result.
The word file is the original file of this project. The pictures are clear then the PDF one.
